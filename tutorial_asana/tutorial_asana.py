# # Asana API Tutorial Notebook
#
# **What this Notebook Does:**
# - Shows how to authenticate and interact with Asana via our custom API layer.
# - Demonstrates how to fetch tasks and comments for a specified project and time period.
# - Computes simple statistics (e.g., tasks created, tasks completed, number of comments).
# - Includes unit tests to ensure the code runs correctly.
#
# **Prerequisites:**
# - A valid Asana Personal Access Token (PAT).
#
# **Instructions:**
# 1. Recommended to your `ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable before running.

# ## Define Config
#
# Here we define all parameters in a single `config` dictionary.
# ou can easily modify:
# - The `project_id` to analyze a different project.
# - The `start_date` and `end_date` to change the timeframe.

# %%

# ## Fetching Task Data
#
#  Using the parameters in `config`, weâ€™ll fetch:
#  - Tasks created within the `start_date` and `end_date`
#  - Tasks completed within the same range
#
#  The `fetch_tasks()` function returns a DataFrame with columns like:
#  - `task_id`
#  - `name`
#  - `assignee`
#  - `created_at`
#  - `completed_at`
#
# %%
# Fetch tasks created in the given period.

# ## Fetching Comments (Stories)
# We now fetch comments for the tasks that were created or completed in the time window.
# `get_task_comments`:
# - Takes a list of task_ids.
# - Returns a DataFrame with `task_id`, `comment_text`, `comment_author`, `comment_created_at`.

# ## Computing Statistics
# We'll compute:
# - Number of tasks created in the period.
# - Number of comments on tasks created in the period.

# ## Statistics for All Users
#
# We can aggregate by user (assignee) to see how many tasks each user created or completed.
#
# **Tasks Created per User**:
# If `created_tasks_df` includes `assignee`, we can group by that column.
