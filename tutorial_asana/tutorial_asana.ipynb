My name is Dhruv Gupta, a Master's student in Data Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am reaching out to express my interest in any assistantship opportunities within your department. With a strong background in data science, software engineering, and business analytics, I am confident in my ability to make meaningful contributions as a Research, Graduate, or Teaching Assistant.\\n\\nMy motivation for data science is deeply rooted in the intersection of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain expertise, captivating my intellectual curiosity. Early exposure to data analysis courses during my academic journey and my innate inquisitiveness ignited my passion for distilling knowledge from raw information. The ability of data science to uncover hidden patterns and trends, thereby synthesizing disparate data points into coherent narratives, became a source of enduring fascination and intellectual engagement. To further explore this territory, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, where I earned a Bachelor of Technology - Computer Science with a specialization in Business Analytics and Optimization.\\n\\nWith a background in Computer Science and a specialization in Business Analytics, I have honed skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning, particularly through my work at PwC India. There, I leveraged tools like Python's Pandas and R to analyze complex datasets, ensuring high data quality and accuracy. I also evaluated model performance using key metrics, gaining valuable experience in extracting meaningful insights and contributing to strategic decision-making.\\n\\nMy previous role as a Software Development Engineer at PeopleStrong enabled me to work on web applications using Flutter and Dart, enhancing my software development and problem-solving a...</td>\n",

My name is Riya Ambolkar, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems at the University of Maryland, expected to graduate in December 2025. I am reaching out to inquire about any available Teaching Assistant or Graduate Assistant positions within the Science Academy.\\nThroughout my academic and professional career, I have gained experience in data analysis, machine learning, and programming, skills that I am eager to apply in an academic setting. As an Information Technology Analyst at Kansai Nerolac Paints, I worked on projects involving predictive modeling, data visualization, and the optimization of business processes, leveraging technologies such as Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. I also have a solid foundation in academic research, having published a paper on a hotel recommendation system using modified BERT in IEEE Xplore, as well as delivering a presentation at the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Smart Systems.\\nMy experience and technical proficiency make me confident that I can contribute effectively to any research or teaching activities within the Science Academy.
