## 🚀 Objective

This project demonstrates how to use **Apache Spark (PySpark)** to ingest, process, analyze, and visualize **real-time Bitcoin price data** from the CoinGecko API using a complete **Dockerized pipeline**.

Students and beginners can use this tutorial to learn how to:
- Ingest streaming data
- Apply transformations and aggregations
- Run time-series machine learning (GBT Regression)
- Save results to S3
- Visualize predictions vs actuals

## 🚀 What is PySpark?

**PySpark** is the Python API for Apache Spark, a fast and general-purpose engine for large-scale data processing. It enables parallel computation on large datasets across distributed computing environments.

### ✅ Key Features of PySpark:
- Distributed data processing with **RDDs** and **DataFrames**
- Real-time stream processing with **Spark Streaming**
- Built-in **MLlib** for scalable machine learning
- SQL-like querying for structured data
- Easily integrates with cloud storage (e.g., **AWS S3**, **HDFS**)

---

## 🧱 Use Cases of PySpark
- Real-time analytics (e.g., IoT, finance)
- Machine learning on big datasets
- ETL pipelines for massive structured/unstructured data
- Batch jobs over petabytes of data
- Log analysis, clickstream processing, and more

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bitcoin_pyspark_project.git
cd bitcoin_pyspark_project
```

### 2. Prepare `.env` File

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name

# Then edit it to include your own AWS credentials and bucket name.
```

### 3. Build and Run Dockerized Spark + Jupyter

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Start pipeline.py
- Ingest Bitcoin prices (90 seconds)
- Run hourly/daily/moving aggregations
- Train GBTRegressor
- Upload results to S3
- Plot the actual vs predicted chart



## ✅ Outputs
- writes stream of json files to the already existed history data
- Spark stream and parses json to Spark 
- prints Aggregation tables (hourly, daily, moving averages)
- Machine Learning Forecasts (GBTRegressor)
- RMSE and R² metrics
- Parquet file and zipped archive
- Upload to AWS S3
- Visualization plot (`output_plot.png`)

## 📎 Useful Commands

```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Rebuild container after changes
docker-compose up --build

# Clean up orphan containers
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
```
