# Tutorial Template: Two Docker Approaches

- This directory provides two versions of the same tutorial setup to help you
  work with Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts inside Docker environments

- Both versions run the same code but use different Docker approaches, with
  different level of complexity and maintainability

## 1. `data605_style` (Simple Docker Environment)

- This version is modeled after the setup used in DATA605 tutorials
- This template provides a ready-to-run environment, including scripts to build,
  run, and clean the Docker container.

- For your specific project, you should:
  - Modify the Dockerfile to add project-specific dependencies
  - Update bash/scripts accordingly
  - Expose additional ports if your project requires them

## Reference Tutorials

- The `tutorial_github` example has been implemented in both environments for you
  to refer to:
  - `tutorial_github_data605_style` uses the simpler DATA605 approach
  - `tutorial_github_causify_style` uses the more complex Causify approach

- Choose the approach that best fits your comfort level and project needs. Both
  are valid depending on your use case.
